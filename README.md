# Projet Num√©ro 3 de Nicolas Ka pour Open Classrooms

If you want to test the code locally:

`npm i` to install dependecies (only vite and sass)<br/>
`npm run dev` to start the dev server.

The file deploy.sh automatically updates the github-pages branch, then github re-deploys the site on his own.

ViteJs is a dev-server/builder that I use to have hot module replacement, it also supports sass and scss files natively (which is quite handy here)

Thank you :)
