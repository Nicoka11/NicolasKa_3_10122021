# Projet Num√©ro 3 de Nicolas Ka pour Open Classrooms

If you want to test the code locally:

`npm i` to install dependecies (only browser-sync and sass)
`npm run watch` to start the dev server. This will make a dev server so you can see the website from all devices on the same local network

Thank you :)
